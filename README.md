# Desktop Automation
Lightweight code to handle desktop tasks I don't want to do by hand

## maintenance-bot
Maintenance Bot is my solution to regular computer maintenance I don't have the patience or desire to complete.
At the moment, his only task is to point out files in my downloads folder that haven't been touched in 90 days or more
and prompt me with actions to deal with them.

### Setup

## toggle-privacy
Toggle Privacy opens the privacy settings for the camera or microphone and toggles them. Pretty simple.
